# Task_Manager_Python
My first capstone data science project of the HyperionDev/Imperial College London Data Science bootcamp. 
The task manager is a programme that helps small businesses manage the tasks assigned to each team member. 

The programme allows users to;

- log in;
- register new users;
- add tasks (inc task title, description, due date and whether it is complete);
- view all tasks;
- view the specific user's tasks.
